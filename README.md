# Diligence: A schedule planning website that provides users a quick and easy way to create daily/weekly schedules


Main Function: 
- User daily and weekly schedule
- User can create "task blocks" that represent events that they often do. "Drag and drop" these so users can create schedules fast; (ex: User has 2 hours of soccer practice everyday, but times vary by day. User can create a 2 hour "soccer practice" event and use this block for each day of that week to create a schedule for the week.)

Other Functions:
- User can upload RPI schedule
- User has RobinHood inspired dashboard to see progress

Other Ideas:
- AI wrapper that provides insight into schedule or other advice
